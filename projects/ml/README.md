Project topic: Practical introduction to machine learning and data analysis.

Project technologies: numpy, scipy, pandas, xgboost, matplotlib, scikit-learn,
classic machine learning, data analysis, feature engineering, data
visualization.

Project workflow:

1. Data analysis and preparation:
   - Downloaded the data from the Kaggle website.
   - Conducted primary data analysis: examined the structure and dimensionality
     of the data, familiarized myself with the features, checked the statistical
     characteristics of numerical features, checked the data for missing values.
   - Identified the training features and the target variable.

2. Statistical analysis and data preprocessing:
   - Investigated the distribution of the target variable, visualized its
     outliers.
   - Cleansed the data of outliers.

3. Feature analysis and Feature Engineering:
   - Transformed categorical features into numerical ones.
   - Visualized the distributions of the training features.
   - Analyzed the heatmap of feature correlations.
   - Created polynomial and quadratic features to track their
     nonlinear dependencies.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.

4. Model training and evaluation:
   - Trained and compared ML models: linear regression, decision tree, gradient
     boosting, and also tested naive methods (mean, median).
   - For each ML model, calculated error metrics on the training and test
     sets: MAE, RMSE.

5. Results comparison:
   - Compiled the results of the ML models' work into a table.
   - Based on it, determined the best ML model for the task.
