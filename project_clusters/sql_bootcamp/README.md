Project topic: SQL Bootcamp.

Day 00: Working with a relational database and SQL statements
— Used SELECT queries with: filtering, sorting, string concatenation, aliases, subqueries, conditional logic, and functions.

Day 01: Working with sets and JOINs
— Utilized set operations.
— Used JOINs: CROSS JOIN, INNER JOIN, NATURAL JOIN.

Day 02: Working with relational algebra
— Applied CTEs in practice.
— Aggregated data using functions.

Day 03: Using SQL DML statements
— Inserted data into the database using the INSERT statement.
— Modified data in the database using the UPDATE statement.
— Deleted data from the database using the DELETE statement.

Day 04: Working with views and time ranges
— Created views with date sequence generation.
— Created materialized views.
— Dropped views after use.

Day 05: Creating and applying indexes
— Created indexes and composite indexes based on B-trees.
— Analyzed queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

Day 06: Integrating business ideas into the data model
— Created tables with primary and foreign keys.
— Set data constraints.

Day 07: Using OLAP constructions to gain insights from data
— Performed multiple aggregations and data groupings.

Day 08: Exploring transaction isolation levels
— Investigated anomalies and mechanisms: "Dirty Read", "Lost Update", "Non-Repeatable Read", "Phantom Read".
— Studied isolation levels: READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE.
— Analyzed deadlocks.

Day 09: Storing procedures in the database
— Created a trigger with a TG_OP condition for operation logging.
— Created a function with a loop to generate a Fibonacci sequence.

Team 00: Solving the traveling salesman problem using SQL

Team 01: Creating a DWH and developing an ETL pipeline
— Developed a DWH.
— Calculated statistical characteristics of data using aggregation.
— Created an ETL pipeline.
