# `school-21` — production-readiness dashboard

Single source of truth for the production-grade overhaul of every
subproject. Updated on every batch commit. Secondary views (GitHub
Projects board, GitHub Issues + milestones) are derived from this
file — never edited by hand.

For **per-subproject detail** — DoD checklist with `[x]` / `[~]` / `[ ]`
ticks, free-form tasks, and a history log — see
[`docs/plans/<track>/<subproject>.md`](docs/plans/). Each subproject
has its own plan file generated from
[`docs/plans/_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/plans/_TEMPLATE.md). The matrix below
stays high-level; the plans hold the detail.

## Flagships

Three subprojects are designated **flagship** — they target DoD-C
("use as a dependency") in addition to the universal A + B (evaluate +
clone & run) treatment:

| ★ | Subproject | Distribution shape | Why this one |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| ★ | [`cpp/s21_containers`](cpp/s21_containers/) | Header-only C++ library — Conan / vcpkg candidate | STL replica (list, map, queue, set, stack, vector, array, multiset). Drop-in for any C++17 project; immediate reusability. |
| ★ | [`c/s21_math`](c/s21_math/)                 | Static library `s21_math.a` — drop-in `math.h` replacement | Simple, well-scoped, easiest first flagship to validate the release pipeline. |
| ★ | [`cpp/SmartCalc_v2.0`](cpp/SmartCalc_v2.0/) | Packaged desktop app — GitHub Releases `.AppImage` / `.dmg` / `.exe` | Demonstrates the full end-user distribution cycle (Qt + MVC + cross-platform installer). Different category from the two libraries above. |

Per-flagship work in scope:

- `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow — builds artefacts, tags semver,
  publishes to GitHub Releases.
- Semantic-version git tags (`v0.1.0`, `v1.0.0`, ...).
- For libraries: a curated `package.{conan,vcpkg}.{py,json}` so the
  library can be consumed as a dependency.
- For the app: per-OS installer build (Linux AppImage, macOS dmg,
  Windows exe).

Designated 2026-05-11. Other 34 subprojects retain A + B scope only;
their READMEs say so explicitly.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✓      | Done — counts as 1.0 in the roll-up                                              |
| ◐      | Partially done / in progress — counts as 0.5                                     |
| ✗      | Not done — counts as 0.0, but the cell stays in the denominator (real gap)       |
| n/a    | Not applicable — cell is **excluded from the denominator** (does not exist here) |
| ★      | Flagship — also targets DoD-C (use as dependency)                                |
| ⚠      | Known broken / blocked by a tactical issue                                       |

> (LICENSE) are meaningful, so the denominator for those rows is 2.
> Previous roll-ups penalised these rows for "missing" work that was
> never in scope; the 2026-05-11 honesty pass corrected this.
>
> Numerator totals were also recounted from current cell values in
> the same pass (the prior 138/296 figure had drifted +25 cells over
