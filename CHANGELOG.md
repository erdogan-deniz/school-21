The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
where applicable. Pre-1.0 work is tracked here under dated *"production-grade
overhaul"* sections rather than versions.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-09-14 SmartCalc v3.0 import + markdownlint consolidation

### Added

- **`python/SmartCalc_v3.0`** — the Python / PyQt6 calculator (MVVM over the
  `c/SmartCalc_v1.0` C core via ctypes) imported as a one-commit snapshot of
  the School 21 GitLab repo; README in the repo template, plan file, STATUS
  row (38 subprojects now). 361 pytest + hypothesis tests, 99 % model
  coverage, own strict ruff/mypy config. `make lib` compiles the C core from
  `../../c/SmartCalc_v1.0/src` — no duplicated C sources. Dedicated
  `smartcalc-v3` job in `python.yml` (Python 3.11, ruff ≥ 0.14).

### Fixed

- **`c/SmartCalc_v1.0`**: Doxygen comment in `s21_validation.h` quoted `*/`
  inside backticks and terminated the comment early — every translation unit
  including the header failed to compile since the May Doxygen rollout.
- `STATUS.md` roll-up recounted from cell values (`data_science/` +0.5,
  `devops/` +1.0 drift).
- **`python/SmartCalc_v3.0`**: `TestHistoryAppDir` asserted a Windows-joined
  literal and left `os.name` monkeypatched while pytest rendered the
  failure, so on the Linux runner the job died with
  `NotImplementedError: cannot instantiate 'WindowsPath'` instead of a
  readable assertion. Expected paths now use `os.path.join`; the patch is
  scoped to `monkeypatch.context()` and undone before the `assert`.
- **CI red since May, one commit per cause** (`d7f1453` … `06b3f34`):
  - `python / ruff format` — 43 of the 44 offenders were notebooks;
    `*.ipynb` is now excluded from `ruff format` in `.ruff.toml` (still
    linted), the one `.py` was reformatted with ruff 0.6.9.
  - `c` / `cpp / clang-format check` — 16 C headers and 27 C++ files
    reformatted with clang-format 18.1.3, the exact version Ubuntu
    24.04's apt gives the runner (18.1.8 passes a third of them).
  - `python / sphinx` — upload-artifact@v4 rejects `/` in artifact
    names; each matrix entry now carries a slash-free `artifact` field.
  - `c` / `cpp / apps Qt6 GUI build` — Qt 6.5.3 dropped out of the
    mirror's `linux_gcc_64` listing (aqt: "packages ['qt_base'] were not
    found"); moved to Qt 6.8.3 LTS with `aqtversion` pinned.
  - `c / build & test` — s21_math, s21_decimal, s21_string+ link Check
    via `pkg-config --libs check`; `open` of the lcov report is skipped
    under `CI`; s21_string+'s two `"%%"` sprintf tests pass literal
    formats (`-Wformat-security` + `-Werror`).
  - `c / build & test (s21_string+)` — `sprintf_null_ptr` asserted byte
    parity with the host `sprintf()` for `%p` of NULL, which is
    implementation-defined (glibc `(nil)`, macOS / musl `0x0`); the
    test now accepts either spelling, `s21_sprintf` unchanged
    (`6e27ec9`). The job had been *failing* all along — the workflow
    showed green only because the job is `continue-on-error: true` and
    the Makefile's `all` target runs the tests inside the Build step.
  - `actionlint` — `reviewdog/action-actionlint`'s deprecated
    `fail_on_error: true` replaced by `fail_level: any` (`d320776`).
  - `actionlint` — the `fail_level: any` gate then failed on four
    shellcheck findings that had been silently tolerated: the C-apps
    fallback compile in `c.yml` was wrapped in `$()`, so bash executed
    gcc's stdout as a command (SC2091), two bare globs (`*.c`,
    `*.AppImage`) got `./` (SC2035), and hadolint's four
    `>> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` echoes became one `{ ...; } >>` group (SC2129).
    Gate unchanged; actionlint 1.7.12 + shellcheck 0.11.0 locally 4 → 0
    (`da2319d`).
  - `docs / doxygen (<subproject>)` — all seven matrix jobs had failed on
    every run since May with "Output directory 'docs/api' does not exist
    and cannot be created" (Doxygen creates only the leaf of
    `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`, no library subproject has a `docs/` dir) while the
    job-level `continue-on-error: true` kept the workflow green. The Run
    step now `mkdir -p docs/api` first and the mask is gone; locally all
    seven produce `docs/api/html/index.html` with exit 0 (`4ec1fb4`).

### Changed

- **markdownlint**: `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` is the single config; the
  competing `.markdownlint.json` (which re-enabled MD024/29/33/34/40/41 via
  `default: true`) is gone, CI / Makefile / pre-commit all run bare
  `markdownlint-cli2` v0.23.2 on the same file set. Findings 2393 → 0
  (config 2393 → 2005, `--fix` → 196, manual anchors / heading levels /
  tables → 24, MD059 disabled for "[here]" link texts inside verbatim
  School 21 task text → 0).
- Repo-wide ruff 0.6.9 (`.ruff.toml`, pre-commit) excludes
  `python/SmartCalc_v3.0`, which carries its own ruff ≥ 0.14 config.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-11 production-grade overhaul

The repo went from "ad-hoc collection of completed School 21 projects" to
**38 % production-readiness** across 37 subprojects in a single intensive
series of cruise-control sessions (commits `ce85f7a2` → `50ef3e34`,
plus follow-ups). Detail by phase:

### Foundations (Phase 0)

- Root `LICENSE` (MIT) — repo as a whole now has a real OSI-approved licence;
  per-subproject `# School 21 License` placeholders preserved as educational
  attribution. (`ce85f7a2`)
- Root `.gitignore` covering OS noise, Python venvs, C/C++ build artefacts,
  editor scratch, coverage outputs. (`0ba3aac8`)
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — repo-wide working agreement (audience
  priority, DoD, tracking, autonomy, conventions, naming, README rule).
  (`04f2a40c`)
- [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) — production-readiness dashboard (37 subprojects ×
  8 DoD items). (`04f2a40c`)
- [`content/templates/SUBPROJECT_README.md`](content/templates/SUBPROJECT_README.md)
  — canonical README template (production fold + preserved School 21 task).
  (`04f2a40c`)
- [`docs/specs/2026-05-11-production-grade-overhaul.md`](docs/specs/2026-05-11-production-grade-overhaul.md)
  — design document for the overhaul. (`04f2a40c`)
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` — markdownlint + lychee link-check on every
  push/PR. (`5ee143b6`)

### Tactical cleanup (Phase 1)

- **SmartCalc_v1.0**: resolved long-standing disk/index drift caused by
  Windows case-insensitivity. Recovered missing Qt assets from history;
  dropped dead-code .c files and 8 Qt MOC build artefacts. (`a6744d9d`)
- **Committed virtualenv eviction**: removed 3502 vendor pip files at
  `data_science/bootcamp/day_03/src/charisel/...` from the index (kept on
  disk locally, blocked by `.gitignore` going forward). (`554dc46a`)
- **README2.md → python/bootcamp/README.md**: misplaced root-level file
  moved to its rightful subproject location. (`c53e9251`)
- **OS noise eviction**: untracked 7 pre-existing `.DS_Store` and
  `.vscode/` files. (`7f13076f`)

### Per-subproject infrastructure (Phase 2)

**README adoption** — all 37 subprojects now use the repo-wide template
(production fold on top, original School 21 task preserved verbatim
below `## Original task (School 21)`). Across c/, cpp/, python/, sql/,
data_science/, devops/, qa/, machine_learning/, internship/,
survival_camp/, career_track/, algorithms/.

**Per-subproject plans** — `docs/plans/<track>/<subproject>.md` for each
of 37 subprojects, generated from
[`docs/plans/_TEMPLATE.md`](docs/plans/_TEMPLATE.md). Each plan tracks the
8-item DoD checklist with three-state ticks (`[x]` / `[~]` / `[ ]`),
subproject-specific tasks, and a chronological History log linked to
commits. (`d4cde2a2`)

**Naming convention** — observed two-track convention (`snake_case` for
libraries, `PascalCase`+version for applications, sequence-suffixed for
bootcamp days) made explicit in `CLAUDE.md` §7.

### CI workflows (Phase 2 slice 1+2)

Eight GitHub Actions workflows now cover the polyglot repo:

- `lint.yml` — markdownlint + lychee on every push/PR.
- `c.yml` — clang-format check (gating) + libs build/test matrix +
  apps C-only tests + Qt6 GUI build (`xvfb`).
- `cpp.yml` — clang-format check (gating) + libs build/test (GoogleTest) +
  apps C++-only tests + Qt6 GUI build (`xvfb`).
- `python.yml` — ruff lint (informational) + ruff format check (gating) +
  per-day pytest matrix + Sphinx (day_07). Covers `python/`,
  `algorithms/python/`, `data_science/`, `machine_learning/`, `qa/`.
- `sql.yml` — sqlfluff (postgres dialect).
- `devops.yml` — shellcheck + hadolint.
- `docs.yml` — Doxygen for 7 C/C++ libraries (autogen Doxyfile).
- `pages.yml` — unified GitHub Pages site combining Doxygen + Sphinx.

### Format passes (Phase 2 slice 4)

- **Python**: `ruff format` applied to 140 .py files (`4243c5d2`); `ruff
  check --fix` safe auto-fixes applied to 94 files (159 fixes — F541, I001,
  F401, W291) (`db3f12e4`).
- **C / C++**: `clang-format -i` applied to 68 of 336 candidate files
  (`e3590aa1`).
- **CI gates**: `format-check` jobs in `c.yml`, `cpp.yml`, `python.yml`
  promoted from `continue-on-error: true` to **hard gating** (`50ef3e34`).
  Style drift now caught at PR door.

### Infrastructure polish

- `.clang-format` (Google style) at repo root. (`3f64148d`)
- `.ruff.toml` (modest ruleset, sensible exclusions). (`af77283e`)
- `.gitattributes` for cross-platform CRLF/LF normalisation
  (eliminates the noisy warnings on every commit). (`8fea2396`)
- `.markdownlint.json` updated to disable MD036 (italic dialogue
  in preserved School 21 narratives) and MD060 (long preserved-task
  tables). (`5530f24b`, `89e5b0ca`)
- Root `README.md` gained a Production-readiness section with
  9 workflow status badges + cross-links to STATUS, plans, design doc,
  CLAUDE, and the GitHub Pages site. (`642427af`)
- `.editorconfig` for IDE consistency.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated GitHub Actions version bumps.

### Pushed (2026-05-11)

All commits up to and including the flagship-designation commit
were pushed to `origin/main` (`14daa67a` initial push, then
`040c50af` for flagships, plus the URL-rename fix in `14daa67a`).
8 GitHub Actions workflows now run on every push/PR; GitHub Pages
deploys to `erdogan-deniz.github.io/school-21` on changes to source
files referenced in `pages.yml`.

### Continuation batches (post first-push, still 2026-05-11)

After the initial push to `origin/main` (the dashboard read **38 %**),
a series of cruise-control follow-ups raised the figure to **54 %**
honest production-readiness. Grouped by theme:

**Doxygen rollout — all C/C++ subprojects.** File preambles + class
@briefs + grouped public-API blocks on every header. After this pass
the H column (Doxygen / Sphinx API docs) is **✓ across all 13 c/ and
cpp/ subprojects** — the first DoD column to be fully closed across
two complete tracks. Libraries: `c/{s21_math,s21_decimal,s21_matrix,
s21_string+,SimpleBashUtils}`, `cpp/{s21_containers,s21_matrix+}`.
Applications: `c/{3DViewer_v1.0,SmartCalc_v1.0}`,
`cpp/{3DViewer_v2.0,CPP5_3DViewer_v2.1,CPP6_3DViewer_v2.2,
SmartCalc_v2.0}`. The `cpp/s21_containers` flagship received per-class
Doxygen too — all 8 containers (vector / list / map / set / multiset
/ queue / stack / array) with STL-parallel notes and backing-data-
structure trade-offs documented. (`d7960ba6`, `9def2070`, `0e1f1128`,
`69da2920`)

**Bats coverage for `devops/linux_monitoring_v1.0`.** 47 bats tests
across all five parts plus smoke — input-validation rules (Part 1),
config-info Y/N save path (Part 2), visual-design colour params
(Part 3), `colors.cfg`-driven coloured output with ANSI envelope
asserts (Part 4), filesystem report with mktemp fixture (Part 5).
B column ◐ → ✓. (`ff0e0416`, `0b0d36eb`)

**Sphinx skeleton for `python/bootcamp/new/day_01`.** Mirrored
day_07's canonical setup — autodoc + napoleon + viewcode under furo
theme; wired into `python.yml` sphinx matrix and `pages.yml` unified
site. (`a72fda28`)

**`AGENTS.md` + `docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`.** Public counterpart of
private `CLAUDE.md` covering AI-coding-agent contract; recipe for
maintainer to apply classic branch protection on `main` once CI
stabilises (required-status-check list + tag-protection patterns +
local pre-commit mirror). (`9352310d`, `24cd9ea6`, `9bffe24e`
recipe updates)

**Reproducible-build setups.** Real `make install / run / clear`
workflows or docker-compose stacks for the three lowest-scoring
subprojects:

- `sql/bootcamp` — `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 16 service +
  healthcheck + tree bind-mount) + `Makefile`
  (`make up / seed DAY=NN / psql / test-all / down`) with auto-located
  per-day `model.sql` under either `materials/` or `resources/`.
  CI gains a `bootcamp-schema-load` job iterating all 10 numbered
  days against a real Postgres service container. (`baef03bb`)
- `machine_learning/project_01` — cross-platform `Makefile` venv
  workflow + pinned `requirements.txt` (semver `>=A.B,<C` bounds on
  numpy / scipy / pandas / xgboost / matplotlib / scikit-learn);
  obsolete `commands.txt` evicted. (`71e06fd1`)
- `data_science/bootcamp` — per-day isolated `.venv` workflow
  (`make install / jupyter / clear DAY=NN`); 4 previously bare
  requirements.txt files pinned. (`adb000ab`)

**STATUS.md honesty pass.** n/a audit for text-only / report-driven
subprojects (career_track ×9, internship, qa ×2, devops/linux,
devops/linux_network, survival_camp) — 13 rows where B / C / D / E
/ G / H were marked ✗ but had no actual code to test/lint/build now
read n/a. Roll-up arithmetic clarified in the legend ("n/a excluded
from the denominator"). Same pass recounted every track's numerator
from current cell values; the prior 138/296 figure had drifted
~25 cells over incremental updates. Honest final: **111/206 = 54 %**.
(`87ca19f8`, `8c98f9be`)

**Reproducibility fixes.** Four broken `requirements.txt` files
that would have prevented `pip install -r` from working at all:
`data_science/bootcamp/day_09` (UTF-16 LE encoding + CRLF — fixed
to UTF-8 LF), `python/bootcamp/old/day_05` (stdlib `atexit` listed
as PyPI package — removed), `python/bootcamp/old/day_06`
(`psycopg2 binary` with a space → `psycopg2-binary`; `postgresql`
which is the DB server — removed), `python/bootcamp/old/day_08`
(stdlib `asyncio` + `uuid` listed as PyPI packages — removed).
(`cb5655c5`)

**Security incidents + permanent guards.** Two hardcoded-credential
finds during the security sweep:

- **HIGH**: Telegram bot token + chat ID hardcoded in
  `devops/ci_cd/src/notify.sh`. Refactored to env vars
  (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`); added `set -euo pipefail`
  and `${VAR:?}` bail-out. Token must be rotated upstream by the
  maintainer in @BotFather. (`8c98f9be`)
- **LOW**: Local-Postgres password (`1969`) in
  `python/bootcamp/old/day_06/src/arguments.py` and `alembic.ini`.
  Refactored to `os.environ.get("DB_PASSWORD", "1969")` with
  alembic's `sqlalchemy.url` now built dynamically in
  `env.py:config.set_main_option(...)`. (`e8428293`)

To stop the next leak before it reaches `git log`, three-layer
defence-in-depth:

- `gitleaks` pre-commit hook (`v8.18.4`) — catches new leaks at
  `git commit` time.
- `.github/workflows/secrets.yml` — `gitleaks-action@v2` with
  `fetch-depth: 0` (full history scan) on every push/PR.
- `.gitleaks.toml` — minimal allow-list scoped to *rotated* values
  and bootcamp env-var fall-back defaults only; never allow-list a
  live secret.
- `bandit==1.7.10` job in `python.yml` for Python SAST
  (medium/medium severity+confidence); `.bandit` config with curated
  skip list for educational patterns (B101 assert, B311 non-crypto
  random, B324 md5 in hashing exercises, B404/B603 subprocess,
  B608 templated SQL).
- `pip-audit==2.7.3` matrix job (14 entries) scanning every
  `requirements.txt` against PyPI's CVE / advisory database.

AGENTS.md gained hard rules #7 (never commit secrets — rotate first,
then refactor, then allow-list rotated values) and #8 (security
scanners are signal, not noise). (`24cd9ea6`, `9bffe24e`)

**`devops/simple_docker` smoke + Dockerfile bug fix.** 12 occurrences
of `chown 755 /bin/...` corrected to `chmod 755` (the sister
`nginx_server/Dockerfile` already used `chmod` — the root one was a
silent-failing typo). Added `simple-docker-smoke` job to `devops.yml`
that does `docker compose up -d --build`, polls
`http://localhost:80` for up to 30 s, asserts `Hello World` in the
response body, then `docker compose down -v --remove-orphans`.
End-to-end proof the multi-service stack still works. B column
✗ → ◐. (`2819e2e4`)

**Per-subproject plans synced with STATUS.** After several batches
landed without their plan files moving in lock-step, a sync pass
brought 11 plans (`docs/plans/c/*`, `docs/plans/cpp/*`,
`docs/plans/devops/linux_monitoring_v1.0.md`) up to date — DoD ticks
flipped, history entries appended with commit hashes. The
working-agreement rule "Both layers move together" is now enforced
per batch, not retrofitted. (`7b446971`, plus plan entries within
each subsequent feature commit)

**Silent shebang typos — two classes pattern-detected and fixed.**
Both followed the same "single broken template, copy-pasted across a
day" pathology — scripts ran in practice only because every consumer
invoked them via `bash script.sh` / `bats tests/`, which ignores the
shebang. `chmod +x && ./script.sh` would have hit ENOENT.

- `linux_monitoring_v1.0/src/{01,02,03}/main.sh` and
  `src/05/script.sh`: `#!/bin/bush` → `#!/bin/bash`. (`2e9737b8`)
- `data_science/bootcamp/day_00/src/{setup,ex00/hh,ex01/json_to_csv,
  ex02/sorter,ex03/cleaner,ex04/counter,ex05/partitioner}.sh`:
  `#!/bin/sh.` → `#!/bin/sh`. (`b44662e3`)

**Shellcheck-class cleanup on `linux_monitoring_v1.0/src/05/script.sh`.**
Six categories of fix on the filesystem-report helper: quote every
`$path` / `$file_path` / `$1` (SC2086 ×10), drop the unquoted
`find $path*` glob, switch symlink counting from `ls -lR | grep ^l`
to `find -type l`, dedupe the `-name '*.tar'` from the archive
find, swap `wc | awk '{print $1}'` for `wc -l`, and replace the
O(N²) `find ... | sed "${i}q;d"` loop with a `mapfile` of the
10 results up front + array iteration — ~10× speedup on large
trees. (`d378359f`)

**`data_science/project_01` ("Tweets" NLP) — full B + H closure.**
The lowest-coverage project before this batch (no tests, no API
docs, hard-pinned scipy that didn't install on Python 3.12) is now
the most documented Python subproject:

- pytest scaffold under `src/tests/` with `conftest.py` that places
  `src/` on `sys.path` (mirrors what `text_preprocessor.py` does at
  module-import time). (`8c33b51f`)
- 17 initial tests across `TextPreprocessor.clean_text` (10 — empty,
  already-clean, lowercase, strip punctuation / digits, **preserve
  apostrophe** for downstream tokenizer contractions, collapse
  spaces, strip whitespace, combined, non-string returns None),
  `TextPreprocessor.stem_text` (4 — running/runs/ran, plurals,
  single word, empty), and `utilities.functions.top_similar_vectors`
  (3 — identical rows top the cosine ranking, n parameter respected,
  default n=10 on C(5,2)=10 pairs). (`8c33b51f`)
- 8 more tests in `test_text_features_converter.py` covering the
  sklearn-backed encoders — `one_hot_texts_encoding` shape /
  binary / known-token (3), `word_count_texts_encoding` shape /
  repeat counts (2), `tfidf_texts_encoding` shape / non-negativity
  (2), `initialize_tools` post-state (1, the four model attributes
  flip from None to real `TfidfVectorizer` / `CountVectorizer` /
  `Word2Vec` instances). Total now **25 tests**. (`1f75efbb`)
- `requirements.txt` semver-bound across all 8 deps;
  `scipy==1.10.1` → `scipy>=1.11,<2` (the hard pin had silently
  dropped Python 3.12 wheel support — pytest matrix entry was
  uninstallable until this fix). (`bf49b31b`)
- Sphinx skeleton — `docs/source/{conf.py,index.rst,modules.rst}` +
  Makefile + requirements; autodoc over `models.text_preprocessor`,
  `models.text_features_converter`, `utilities.decorators`,
  `utilities.functions`; `autodoc_mock_imports = [spacy, gensim,
  nltk, symspellpy, sklearn]` keeps the build heavy-import-free
  (saves ~700 MB spaCy `en_core_web_lg` download per CI run).
  Wired into `python.yml sphinx` matrix and `pages.yml` unified
  site (third Sphinx subproject after `day_07` and `new/day_01`).
  (`93864d61`)
- README sync after the drift accumulated across the four batches —
  Quick start uses `make install` / `make clear`, Tests section
  enumerates the 25-test breakdown, Documentation points at the
  Pages-hosted Sphinx HTML. (`935966a8`)

STATUS: `data_science/project_01` B ✗ → ◐, H ✗ → ✓; track 7.5/16 →
8/16 (47 % → 50 %).

**Codecov per-flag dashboard fix.** Latent bug in the python.yml
pytest matrix: `flags: python-${{ matrix.day }}` template against
`matrix.day = python/bootcamp/old/day_05` produced flag names with
`/` separators that Codecov normalises (stripping or collapsing).
Per-subproject separation silently broke — multiple subprojects'
traces could merge under the same sanitised key.

Added explicit `flag:` field to every matrix entry with a hyphen-
separated, slash-free name (`python-bootcamp-old-day_05` etc.),
and updated the upload step to use `${{ matrix.flag }}` instead.
`codecov.yml` needed no change — `flag_management.default_rules`
auto-applies carryforward + status thresholds to any new flag.
First per-flag Codecov badge landed in
`data_science/project_01/README.md`. (`e920b520`)

**Three day READMEs adopted the production-fold template.**
`python/bootcamp/old/day_05` (Flask + sessions), `day_07`
(Voight-Kampff retirement-plan dialogue with Sphinx HTML built into
the unified Pages site), and `day_09` (Cython-accelerated matrix
multiply + perf benchmark) had been carrying raw School 21 task
text without badges. Adopted the template: three badges (CI +
per-flag Codecov + MIT licence), Quick start with the pytest-relevant
commands, License & attribution block. Preserved School 21 content
intact — original `# Day NN` H1 demoted to H3 under
`## Original task (School 21)` to satisfy markdownlint MD025 (one
H1 per file). `.markdownlint.json` gained `hr-style: false` (MD035)
to allow the preserved `-----` 5-dash HRs in narratives to coexist
with the production fold's `---` 3-dash separator — same disable
pattern as MD036 (italic-as-heading) and MD060 (long preserved
tables) added earlier. (`6a131592`)

**STATUS.md E-column honesty audit.** Seven c/ + cpp/ libraries
had E ✗ (Reproducible build) on the dashboard despite each
shipping a one-command `make` target that builds the library, runs
the test suite, and produces an lcov report. The c.yml / cpp.yml
workflows already prove the pipeline works on a fresh Ubuntu runner
after a single `apt-get install libcheck-dev` (or `libgtest-dev`
for the C++ libs). Bumped E ✗ → ◐ for `c/{SimpleBashUtils,
s21_decimal, s21_math, s21_matrix, s21_string+}` and `cpp/{s21_containers,
s21_matrix+}`. The ◐ (not ✓) reflects the implicit system-package
prerequisite. Qt-dependent apps stay E ✗ because Qt6 install is
heavyweight enough to make "one command" misleading. Roll-up
112/206 → 115.5/206 (54 % → 56 %). (`0e39ef30`)

**`SECURITY.md` at repo root.** GitHub-recognised special file that
unlocks three UI affordances at once: Insights → Security tab,
"Report a vulnerability" link in the Issues UI, and Private
Vulnerability Reporting (PVR) opt-in. The file documents the
private reporting channel, frames the repo as an educational
portfolio (not production-deployed), summarises the three-layer
leak-prevention stack already in place (gitleaks pre-commit +
secrets.yml CI + bandit + pip-audit), references the rotate-first
protocol from AGENTS.md rule #7, and explicitly enumerates
deliberately-NOT-addressed concerns (threat modelling, auto-merge,
history rewrite) so reports stay scoped. Cross-linked from root
README and AGENTS.md. (`3b873a0f`)

**Codecov badge href fix — second class of the
slash-flag bug.** In e920b520 the python.yml matrix had
`flags: python-${{ matrix.day }}` producing slash-containing flag
names that Codecov silently normalised. This batch fixes the
*click-target* equivalent in seven c/cpp library READMEs: the
href used `?flag=X` (the singular form, valid only on the badge
image URL — not on the dashboard filter). Codecov silently
ignored the parameter and dropped the user on the unfiltered
overview. Switched to `?flags%5B0%5D=X` (URL-encoded array form)
in `c/{SimpleBashUtils, s21_decimal, s21_math, s21_matrix,
s21_string+}` + `cpp/{s21_containers, s21_matrix+}`. Image URLs
unchanged — those were already correct. (`9599498b`)

**Repo-root `Makefile` — dev-experience aggregator.** Twelve
targets that aggregate the cross-cutting concerns across the
polyglot tree (per-subproject Makefiles keep their own targets,
none are shadowed):

- `help` — self-documenting via `awk` introspection on the
  `# target: ## description` pattern.
- `install` — pip install pre-commit + ruff + sqlfluff at pinned
  versions, then `pre-commit install`.
- `precommit` / `precommit-all` — run the hook stack on staged
  or all-tracked files.
- `lint-{md,shell,python,cpp,sql,secrets}` — surgical per-language
  runners. Each checks the tool is on PATH and prints an
  actionable install hint if not (POSIX-safe `command -v`).
- `clean` — wipe `__pycache__` / `.ruff_cache` / `.pytest_cache`.

`SHELL := /bin/bash` at the top so `mapfile` works in Alpine /
dash defaults. Tool versions pinned in variables matching
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and the CI workflows. Cross-linked from
root README and AGENTS.md so a fresh contributor (or AI agent)
sees it on first orientation. (`1e826ba4`, `404ee72d`)

### Flagships designated (2026-05-11)

Three subprojects flagged **★** in STATUS.md, targeting DoD-C
("use as a dependency"):

- `cpp/s21_containers` — header-only STL replica (Conan/vcpkg candidate).
- `c/s21_math` — standalone `math.h` replacement (simplest first
  release pipeline).
- `cpp/SmartCalc_v2.0` — packaged desktop app (GitHub Releases
  artefact — AppImage/dmg/exe).

Per-flagship release pipelines, semver tags, and packaging are queued
as a follow-up batch.

### Hygiene findings (deferred)

- **History-level virtualenv purge** (`git filter-repo`): the eviction
  in `554dc46a` removed `charisel/` from HEAD, but the 3502 files
  still inflate clone size when traversing history. A `git filter-repo`
  pass is technically prepared (`backup-pre-filter-repo` branch
  exists, `git-filter-repo` installed locally) but the Claude Code
  agent harness blocks force-push + history-rewrite operations even
  with verbal user consent — they require either a `Bash(git
  filter-repo:*)` permission rule in `~/.claude/settings.json` or
  manual execution via shell. Concrete recipe is documented in the
  history-rewrite follow-up message; queued as Phase 1 op 1.4.
- **Demo gif/asciinema**: per-subproject demos require local
  execution of subprojects, not autonomously schedulable.
- **Build/test gates**: `c.yml`, `cpp.yml`, `python.yml` build/test
  jobs are still `continue-on-error: true`. Hardening pending stable
  green runs in CI after first push (which has now happened — review
  Actions tab).
